    <h2>Hi GUYS IT IS ME</h2>
        <P>
            <title> What the hell is going on in the world</title>  
            As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have real-time information on current events or the latest political developments. Political situations are highly dynamic and can change rapidly. To get the most accurate and up-to-date information on the current state of world politics, I recommend checking reputable news sources, official government statements, or reliable news websites. These sources can provide you with the latest information on political events, policies, and global affairs.
